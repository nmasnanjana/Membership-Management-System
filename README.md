## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **For Docker deployment**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **For local development**: Python 3.8 or higher, pip, MySQL server, virtual environment (recommended)

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Membership-Management-System
```

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (or update the existing one):

```env
# Django Settings
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

# Server Port Configuration (exposed to host)
PORT=8000

# MySQL Database Configuration (for Docker container)
DB_NAME=membership_db
DB_USER=mms_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=3306

# MySQL Root Password (for container initialization)
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_root_password_here
```

**Important**: 
- Update `SECRET_KEY`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` with secure values
- `DB_HOST=db` is required for Docker Compose (uses service name)
- `PORT` can be changed if you want to use a different port

#### 3. Build and Start Containers

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will:
- Build the Django application container
- Create and start MySQL container
- Run database migrations
- Start the web server on port 8000 (or your configured PORT)

#### 4. Create Superuser

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### 5. Access the Application

- Web application: `http://localhost:8000` (or your configured PORT)
- MySQL is **not exposed** to the host - only accessible within Docker network

#### 6. Useful Docker Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (⚠️ deletes database data)
docker-compose down -v

# Restart containers
docker-compose restart

# Run migrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Access Django shell
docker-compose exec web python manage.py shell
```

### Option 2: Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Membership-Management-System
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate Virtual Environment

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

# Server Port Configuration
PORT=8000

# MySQL Database Configuration
DB_NAME=membership_db
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password_here
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
```

**Note**: 
- For production, set `DEBUG=False` and use a secure `SECRET_KEY`
- Update MySQL credentials (DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD) with your actual MySQL server details
- Make sure the database exists before running migrations
- For local development, use `DB_HOST=localhost`
- For Docker, use `DB_HOST=db` (Docker service name)

### 6. Run Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

**Important**: Before running migrations, make sure:
1. MySQL server is running
2. Database is created: `CREATE DATABASE membership_db;` (or your configured DB_NAME)
3. Database user has proper permissions

Then run migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This will create all database tables in your MySQL database.

### 7. Create Superuser

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to create an admin account.

### 8. Collect Static Files (Optional)

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### 9. Run Development Server

```bash
# Use PORT from .env file (default: 8000)
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:${PORT:-8000}
```

Or simply:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` (or your configured PORT)

## 📝 Notes

- **Database**: The system uses MySQL database (configured via .env file)
  - For Docker: Database runs in a separate container, not exposed to host
  - For local: Requires MySQL server installation
- **Docker Network**: All containers communicate via internal Docker network (`mms_network`)
  - Only port 8000 (or configured PORT) is exposed to host
  - MySQL is only accessible within Docker network for security
- **Port Configuration**: Server port is configurable via `PORT` environment variable
  - Default: 8000
  - Update `.env` file to change port
- **Database Credentials**: Stored in `.env` file (DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT)
  - For Docker: Use `DB_HOST=db` (Docker service name)
  - For local: Use `DB_HOST=localhost`
- **Media Files**: Stored in the `media/` directory
- **QR Codes**: Automatically generated in PNG format
- **Excel Exports**: Use the `.xlsx` format
- **Session Timeout**: Set to 6 hours (can be adjusted in settings)
- **Automatic Member Deactivation**: Runs via Django signals (no cron jobs needed)
- **Bulk Attendance Marking**: Includes auto-save feature (data saved in browser)
- **Security**: All pages require authentication - site is fully secured
- **Permissions**: Normal staff can only mark new attendance; superusers have full access
